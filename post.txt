Notes
1. Code style:
db: all tables & rows are lower-case
PHP: vars. & functions lower case with underscores
ex: this_is_a_function or this_is_a_variable
PS: code must be modular
2. CRUD & SQL:
must use prepaired statements
for any data from user to avoid SQL Injection
3. Password:
username, password are always root, root
PS: db name will be cse
